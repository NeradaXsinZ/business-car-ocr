# business-card-ocr

## Motivation
This application is a solution to an [Asymmetrik programming challenge](http://asymmetrik.com/programming-challenges/) 

## About 
The business-card-ocr tool takes a .txt file with information about a person and parses that file for a name, phone number, and email address

## Requirements
This application requires Java to run, and uses Gradle as a build tool

## Application Inputs
This program takes a single txt file as input via the command line. The file should contain info normally found on a business card, seperated by new lines.
